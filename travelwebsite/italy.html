         <p class="changeColor">No wonder they call it the Eternal City. It’s nearly 2,800 years since Rome was 
            (allegedly) founded and — barring a couple of hiccups in the Middle Ages — it’s been 
            going strong ever since. The result is a giant layer cake of art, faith and history: and 
            if you’ve even a passing interest in humanity’s developing story, and the triumphs and disasters
             we’ve encountered en route, you’ll be buzzing from start to finish. On any given day here, you
              might stare into the stern face of a Republican matriarch, preserved in marble for two millennia;
               gaze at 500-year-old paintings which are still the finest frescoes in the world; and finish with
                a plate of black truffle carbonara, and a rich, fruity glass of Montepulciano red — in a moment 
                that’s all about the here and now. It’s an intoxicating mix.</p> <br>

        <div class="whatToDo"> 
            <h2>What to do</h2> <br> <br>
            <p class="changeColor">There are two hard and fast rules. Don’t try to do everything in Rome in a single trip; and don’t restrict
                 yourself to Rome’s Holy Trinity: the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the Vatican Museums. Yes, they’re 
                 justifiably famous, but in the peak season (between Easter and early autumn), they can be mind-bogglingly 
                 busy too. Go when everybody else does — in the morning and early afternoon — and you’ll spend your entire 
                 holiday looking at the back of other people’s heads.</p>
                <br> <br>               
            <h2>Because most visitors have the same tick- <br>list, Rome’s ‘secrets’ are more or less empty</h2>
            <br> <br>
            <p class="changeColor">To avoid the crush, book a visit with a private guide, from an outfit such as Eyes of Rome. They can, 
                for example, get you into the Vatican Museum 90 minutes before the public. Or go at the end of the day, 
                about an hour before the last tickets are sold — when everyone’s footsore and hungry and thinking about supper.
                 At that point, the crowds suddenly thin. Once you’re in, stay there until you’re actually asked to leave
                 . For a few deliciously tranquil minutes you may end up having somewhere like the Sistine Chapel to yourself.</p> <br>
            <p class="changeColor">Then, in the meantime, work the B-list. Rome’s lesser-known sights would be the stars of any other city,
                 and because most visitors have the same tick-list, these “secrets” are more or less empty. They’re often just 
                 a few steps away from the main attractions too. Take Trajan’s Market, for example; it’s across the road
                  from the Forum — but rendered almost invisible by a cloak of dark, utilitarian brick. Inside, you’ll discover one of Rome’s most complete Imperial monuments: a vast complex of offices and auditoria, built between 100 and 110AD to service Trajan’s new forum. Chances are, you’ll have its ancient pavements to yourself.</p>
